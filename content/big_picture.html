<p>According to the graph ploting medicare coverage proportions in each state, you can see that there is discrepancies among the states when the coverage rates should be identical since Medicare is a federal program. From red to blue, red indicates lower medicare coverage, and blue indicates higher medicare coverage. There are several states on the eastern part of the US that provide relatively lower medicare coverage medical services to the patients, while other states provide relatively higher medicare coverage. This suggests that there may be differences in the way that Medicare is implemented in different states, or that there are other factors at play that affect the federal reimbursement of Medicare services. It is also possible that the data used to create the graph is not entirely accurate, or that it does not capture the full picture of Medicare coverage in each state. Regardless, it is clear that there is a need for further investigation into the disparities in Medicare coverage among the states.</p>

<h3>What factors can affect Medicare Coverage proportions?</h3>
<div id="length-of-stay" class="section level4">
<h4>Length of Stay</h4>

<p>As you can see from the plot above, as the medicare coverage increases, the length of stay generally decreases, meaning that the time that a patient spend in hospital is negatively related to medicare coverage proportion. This relationship may suggest that patients who have higher levels of Medicare coverage are able to access more timely and efficient medical care, leading to shorter hospital stays. On the other hand, patients with lower levels of Medicare coverage may face barriers to accessing care, leading to longer hospital stays. It is also possible that other factors, such as the availability of other forms of health insurance or the presence of chronic health conditions, may play a role in this relationship. Further research and analysis would be needed to determine the exact cause of this relationship and its implications for healthcare policy.</p>
