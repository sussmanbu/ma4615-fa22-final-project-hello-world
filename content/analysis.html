<h2>Motivation for our Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
<p>Medicare is a national health insurance program in the United States that provides coverage to the elderly and people with disabilities. In 1965, after the legislation was signed by President Lyndon B Johnson, Americans started receiving Medicare health coverage and medical insurance benefits first took effect. After more than 5 decades, by august 2022, there were nearly 65 million people receiving health coverage through Medicare. Nowadays, medicare spending account for about 20% of total national health spending per year. To be eligible for Medicare coverage, individuals must be 65 years of age or older and have paid into the Medicare system through their taxes while working. We are interested in medicare payment because Medicare spending in the United States has increased significantly in recent years —- increased by more than $200 billion since 2010. In addition, it is also a significant part (15.3%) of the overall healthcare spending. With the aging population, Medicare spending is projected to increase significantly over the next decade.</p>
<p>Thus, in the project, we aim to explore factors that make U.S. healthcare so expensive by focusing on medicare spending because it is one of the largest sources of healthcare funding in the country. To make the project manageable, we decided to focus on inpatient Medicare spending due to data availability.</p>

<h2>Breadth of EDA</h2>
<p>During initial data analysis, we analyzed <a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-summary-by-type-of-service/medicare-inpatient-hospitals/medicare-inpatient-hospitals-by-provider-and-service">Medicare Inpatient Hospitals by Provider and Service</a>. We first explored the relationship between Average medicare Payment and average total payments.</p>
<div id="plot-1-the-relationship-between-average-medicare-payments-and-average-total-payments" class="section level3">
<h3>Plot 1: The relationship between Average Medicare Payments and Average Total Payments</h3>
<p>We first examined the relationship between medicare payment and total payment.</p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The Medicare covered payment increases as the total payment increases. This makes sense because Medicare covers payment mostly by a certain percentage, but may vary depending on differences in hospital charge structures. In the graph, each datapoint represents one state. From the graph, you can see Mean Medicare Payment varies in states with some states’ values cluster together. If you examine closely, you will realize the ratio of Medicare Payment and Total Payment also varies by state. For the next two plots, we explored Medicare payments and the ratio between Medicare payment and Total Payment in each states.</p>
</div>
<div id="plot-2-the-ratio-of-medicare-payment-and-total-payment-for-each-state" class="section level3">
<h3>Plot 2: The ratio of medicare payment and total payment for each state</h3>
<p>Next, we zoom in to see if the ratio of medicare payment and total payment varies across states.</p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Washington DC and Hawaii have the lowest ratio of medical payment and total payment while South Dakota and Maryland have the highest ratio. From the above graph that describes the percentage the Medicare payment in the total payment, it’s quite clear that there’s a standard of 85% that can be found within all the states in the U.S. However, it’s quite surprising to find that there are almost half of the states do not fulfill this standard. To be more specific, it means the residents of these states have to afford 15-25% of the total payment even if they have medicare covered. Also, there are states that covered more than 90% of the payment which means the person only has to afford less than 10% of the total payment. The disparity is visually huge among all the states and it is something that could be further analyzed to see if there’s a need to improve the Medicare system in each state.</p>

<div id="plot-3-mean-medicare-payment-in-u.s.-states" class="section level3">
<h3>Plot 3: Mean Medicare payment in U.S. States</h3>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Theoretically, Medicare coverage should be the same across all states in the United States. Since it is a national program, the benefits and services it covers should be standardized, meaning that an individual who is enrolled in Medicare in one state will have the same coverage as someone who is enrolled in Medicare in another state. However, during initial exploratory data analysis, we found that average medicare payment varies greatly from state to state. As a result, we decided to shift our focus to understand the sources of variation in medicare payment across different geographic areas and identify sources that have the largest impact on medicare payment variations. We conducted some literature reviews and identified various possible factors including premium, geographic practice cost indices, length of stay, readmission rate, health status, income level, race, poverty rate, GDP, cover charged, and hierarchical condition category (HCC).</p>

<div id="plot-4-medicare-coverage-vs.-length-of-stay-in-hospital" class="section level3">
<h3>Plot 4: Medicare Coverage vs. Length of stay in hospital</h3>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We further examined the relationship between Medicare coverage(Medicare payment/total payment) and length of stay in hospital. We summarized the medicare coverage of each state and merge with data of average length of stay in hospital of people with medicare in each state. Then, we plotted the relationship between Medicare coverage and average length of stay. As shown above, there is a negative relationship between Medicare coverage and average length of stay, implying that Medicare pays a higher percentage to doctors’ wage in states with shorter patient lengths of stay. This is because when a patient stays in the hospital longer, more of the Medicare payment goes to pay for medicines, medical equipment, treatments, etc., so the doctor gets a smaller percentage of the Medicare payment.</p>

<h2>Depth of EDA</h2>
<div id="factor-i-medicare-payment-vs.-premium" class="section level3">
<h3>Factor I: Medicare Payment vs. Premium</h3>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The first plot shows the regression plot between premium and medicare Payment. There is a positive regression relationship between the two variables, indicating that Medicare Payment increases as Premium increases. However, when we wanted to explore Medicare payment data for each state and reordered by premium, we saw no apparent patterns among the states. Although there is a positive relationship indicated in the regression plot, there is no obvious pattern shown in the boxplot. Therefore, we cannot conclude that medicare Payment goes up with the increase in premium. In other words, more expensive medicare premium does not bring greater medicare Payment, and cheaper premium does not lower the payment either.</p>
</div>
<div id="factor-ii-medicare-payment-vs.-gdp" class="section level3">
<h3>Factor II: Medicare Payment vs. GDP</h3>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Then We decide to investigate the relationship between GDP and Medicare Payment since we believe that a state with higher GDP has more expensive medical care, and medicare payment should also rise to cover the corresponding inflation. According to the plot above, medicare payment increases as GDP goes up, which means that the average medicare payment for each beneficiary is positively correlated with the GDP of the state where the beneficiary resides. This observation could be potentially explained by the fact that GDP could impact the cost of living. As GDP increases, the cost of living may also increase, which could lead to higher prices for medical goods and services. If the cost of providing medical care increases, Medicare may need to adjust its payment rates in order to cover these costs.</p>

<div id="factor-iii-medicare-payment-vs-hierarchical-condition-category-hcc" class="section level3">
<h3>Factor III: Medicare Payment vs Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC)</h3>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Hierarchical condition category (HCC) is a coding system that is used in the United States to classify medical conditions for the purpose of determining the amount of reimbursement that a healthcare provider will receive from Medicare. Higher HCC score means the providers will receive higher reimbursement. There is one obvious outlier, which is DC, it has high Medicare payment but low HCC score. As indicated in the graph, there is limited relationship between Medicare payment and HCC.</p>
</div>
<div id="factor-iv-medicare-payment-vs-readmission-rate" class="section level3">
<h3>Factor IV: Medicare Payment vs Readmission Rate</h3>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Readmission rate is the percentage of patients who are admitted to a hospital again within a certain period of time after being discharged. This rate is often used as a measure of the quality of care provided by a hospital, as higher readmission rates may indicate that patients are not receiving the care they need to prevent their condition from worsening or recurring. Starting 2012, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) reduces at max three percent of Medicare payment for hopsitals that have high 30 days readmission rate. There is also limited relationship between Readmission Rate and Medicare Payment shown in this graph.</p>
</div>
<div id="factor-v-medicare-payment-vs-length-of-stay" class="section level3">
<h3>Factor V: Medicare Payment vs Length of Stay</h3>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We further examined the relationship between medicare payment and length of stay in hospital. We summarized the medicare payment of each state and merge with data of average length of stay in hospital of people with medicare in each state. Then, we plotted the relationship between Medicare payment and average length of stay. As shown above, there is a negative relationship between Medicare payment and average length of stay, implying that Medicare pays a higher percentage to doctors’ wage in states with shorter patient lengths of stay. This is because when a patient stays in the hospital longer, more of the Medicare payment goes to pay for medicines, medical equipment, treatments, etc., so the doctor gets a smaller percentage of the Medicare payment.</p>
</div>
<div id="factor-vi-medicare-payment-vs-health-status" class="section level3">
<h3>Factor VI: Medicare Payment VS Health Status</h3>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The result is surprising. We expect a negative relationship because the health status of an individual should affect the overall cost of the care. People with chronic illness may require more frequently and costly medical intervention than people who are in good health, thus their medicare payment should be higher. But the graph shows opposite relationship that better health status results in higher medicare payment.</p>
</div>
<div id="factor-vii-medicare-payment-vs-geographic-practice-cost-index" class="section level3">
<h3>Factor VII: Medicare Payment VS Geographic Practice Cost Index</h3>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" />
The Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) is the factor used by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to adjust payment rates based on the relative cost of providing these services in different areas of the country. The GPCI takes into account differences in the cost of labor, rent, and other expenses associated with providing medical services in different regions. The graph shows a positive relationship, meaning that if the GPCI for a certain area is higher than the national average, Medicare payment will be adjusted upward to reflect the higher cost of providing those services in that location. Conversely, if the GPCI for a certain area is lower than the national average,Medicare payment for services provided in that area will be adjusted downward.</p>

<h2>Flaws and Limitations of EDA</h2>
<p>First, due to the availability of the database, we were unable to obtain data from more years, which resulted in our data being insufficient to analyze and obtain any long-term effects. Secondly, it was difficult for us to use the raw data set for the analysis of some factors, which resulted in our dataset not being large enough, so we obtained several not ideal correlations. In addition, in real life, Medicare payment is a variable that is influenced by so many factors, so any single variable on Medicare payment would not be very significant. We need to collect and analyze more factors that may affect Medicare payment for the analysis.</p>
